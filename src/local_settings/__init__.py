    """Merge local settings from file with base settings, then check.

    Returns a new dict containing the base settings and the loaded
    settings. Includes:

        - base settings
        - settings from extended file(s), if any
        - settings from file
        - settings from env, if any env settings are defined

    Settings loaded from the local settings file(s) will override base
    settings. If any env settings are defined and set in the environ,
    they will override base settings and settings loaded from file(s).

    After all settings are loaded from the various sources, they will be
    checked to ensure that all local settings have been set.

    If a file name is passed and the file exists, local settings will be
    loaded from it and, if ``prompt=True`` (see below), any missing
    settings will be appended to it. If the file doesn't exist, it will
    be created and, if ``prompt=True``, all settings will be added to
    it.

    If a file name isn't passed: if the ``LOCAL_SETTINGS_FILE``
    environment variable is set, the specified file will be used;
    otherwise ``{base_path}/local.{ext}`` will be used. Settings will be
    appended or added as described above.

    ``base_path`` is used when ``file_name`` is relative; if it's not
    passed, it will be set to the current working directory.

    When ``prompt`` is ``True``, the user will be prompted for missing
    local settings, which will be added to the specified or discovered
    local settings file. By default, the user is prompted only when
    running on TTY. The ``LOCAL_SETTINGS_CONFIG_PROMPT`` environment
    variable can be used to set ``prompt``.

    When ``quiet`` is ``True``, informational messages will not be
    printed. The ``LOCAL_SETTINGS_CONFIG_QUIET`` environment variable
    can be used to set ``quiet``.

    When ``env_only`` is ``True``, only env settings will be loaded--
    all the file loading steps noted above will be skipped. Note that
    if other, non-env local settings are defined, this will cause an
    error when ``env_only=True``.

    ``dotenv_file`` can be used to specify a .env file for loading
    local settings configuration environment variables. This can be the
    same .env file used for local settings or a different one. It can be
    specified as an absolute, relative (to ``base_path``), or asset
    path.

    .. note:: When setting flags via environment variables, use a JSON
        value like 'true', '1', 'false', or '0'.

    See :meth:`.Loader.load` and :meth:`.Checker.check` for more info.
